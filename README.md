 ## **💬 About me** 
  
  My name is Mauricio, I am a backend oriented Full-Stack programmer. From an early age my interest in the world of technology began. After a few years working in customer service, I decided to go into the world of programming. I entered the SoyHenry bootcamp where I managed to strengthen both my technical skills and my soft skills. My hobbies: Piano, movies, video games, nature and coding.
